Champion README ~ K.O.

The champion that I will be doing for this game is some form of elemental* weapon(s).

Some examples/ideas:
   - Ice Gun: Freezes enemy in place for 3-5 seconds
   - Fire Gun: Causes 3-5 seconds of "burn" damage (1-2 HP a second?)
   - Lazer Gun: Lots of hit points but 5-10 second cool-down
   - Water Gun (Squirt Gun?): ~Very~ short range, but insta-kill**
   - Tazer: Knocks out enemies for 15-20 seconds, percentage/half health, short range



*Too stereo-typical?
**Duh, robots.
